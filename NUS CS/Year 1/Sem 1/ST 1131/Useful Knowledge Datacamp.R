Summarise each group down to one row


summarise() creates a new data frame. It returns one row for each combination of grouping variables; if there are no grouping variables, the output will have a single row summarising all observations in the input. It will contain one column for each grouping variable and one column for each of the summary statistics that you have specified.

summarise() and summarize() are synonyms.
Usage
summarise(.data, ..., .by = NULL, .groups = NULL)

Examples
# A summary applied to ungrouped tbl returns a single row
mtcars %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(disp), n = n())
#>       mean  n
#> 1 230.7219 32

# Usually, you'll want to group first
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(disp), n = n())
#> # A tibble: 3 Ã— 3
#>     cyl  mean     n
#>   <dbl> <dbl> <int>
#> 1     4  105.    11
#> 2     6  183.     7
#> 3     8  353.    14





Group by one or more variables
Most data operations are done on groups defined by variables. group_by() takes an existing tbl and converts it into a grouped tbl where operations are performed "by group". ungroup() removes grouping.
Usage
group_by(.data, ..., .add = FALSE, .drop = group_by_drop_default(.data))
ungroup(x, ...)
Ordering
Currently, group_by() internally orders the groups in ascending order. This results in ordered output from functions that aggregate groups, such as summarise().
When used as grouping columns, character vectors are ordered in the C locale for performance and reproducibility across R sessions. If the resulting ordering of your grouped operation matters and is dependent on the locale, you should follow up the grouped operation with an explicit call to arrange() and set the .locale argument. For example:
data %>%
  group_by(chr) %>%
  summarise(avg = mean(x)) %>%
  arrange(chr, .locale = "en")

Keep rows that match a condition
The filter() function is used to subset a data frame, retaining all rows that satisfy your conditions. To be retained, the row must produce a value of TRUE for all conditions. Note that when a condition evaluates to NA the row will be dropped, unlike base subsetting with [.]
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Usage
filter(.data, ..., .by = NULL, .preserve = FALSE

Useful filter functions
There are many functions and operators that are useful when constructing the expressions used to filter the data:
    ==, >, >= etc
    &, |, !, xor()
    is.na()
    between(), near()

#Variance: The average of the squared distances from each data point to the mean. It's a measure of how spread out the data is. The formula involves squaring the differences between each data point and the mean, summing these squares, and dividing by the number of data points minus one. High variance indicates more spread out data.
#Standard Deviation (SD): The square root of the variance, providing a measure of spread that is in the same units as the data. It's easier to interpret than variance because it relates more directly to the data points.
#Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD): Similar to standard deviation but uses absolute values instead of squaring the distances. It treats all deviations from the mean equally, without giving extra weight to larger deviations like the standard deviation does.
#Quartiles and Quantiles: Methods to divide the data into equal parts. Quartiles split the data into four parts, and the Interquartile Range (IQR) is the difference between the first and third quartiles, offering a measure of spread that is robust against outliers.
#Outliers: Points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. They can be identified using the IQR; any data point more than 1.5 times the IQR below the first quartile or above the third quartile is considered an outlier.

Sampling WITHOUT replacement = each pick is dependent



Create, modify, and delete columns
mutate() creates new columns that are functions of existing variables. It can also modify (if the name is the same as an existing column) and delete columns (by setting their value to NULL).

  select(name, mass) %>%
  mutate(
    mass2 = mass * 2,
    mass2_squared = mass2 * mass2

    Default list of aesthetic mappings to use for plot. If not specified, must be supplied in each layer added to the plot.

Details
ggplot() is used to construct the initial plot object, and is almost always followed by a plus sign (+) to add components to the plot.
There are three common patterns used to invoke ggplot():
    ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x, y, other aesthetics))
    ggplot(data = df)
    ggplot()
The first pattern is recommended if all layers use the same data and the same set of aesthetics, although this method can also be used when adding a layer using data from another data frame.
The second pattern specifies the default data frame to use for the plot, but no aesthetics are defined up front. This is useful when one data frame is used predominantly for the plot, but the aesthetics vary from one layer to another.
The third pattern initializes a skeleton ggplot object, which is fleshed out as layers are added. This is useful when multiple data frames are used to produce different layers, as is often the case in complex graphics.
The data = and mapping = specifications in the arguments are optional (and are often omitted in practice), so long as the data and the mapping values are passed into the function in the right order. In the examples below, however, they are left in place for clarity.


# Create a histogram of group_size
ggplot(data = restaurant_groups, mapping = aes(group_size)) +    geom_histogram(bins = 5)
# OR
ggplot(restaurant_groups, aes(group_size)) +    geom_histogram(bins = 5)
# Typically
ggplot( Data, mapping(using aes = () )) + geom_(type_of_graph)(bins = n)
# IF DATA IS NOT A DATA FRAME, AND IS A VECTOR, USE fortify() TO MAKE IT A DATAFRAME


# Create probability distribution
size_distribution <- restaurant_groups %>%
  # Count number of each group size
  count(group_size) %>%
  # Calculate probability
  mutate(probability = n / sum(n))
size_distribution

# Calculate expected group size
expected_val <- sum(size_distribution$group_size *
                    size_distribution$probability)
expected_val

# Calculate probability of picking group of 4 or more
size_distribution %>%
  # Filter for groups of 4 or larger
  filter(group_size>=4) %>%
  # Calculate prob_4_or_more by taking sum of probabilities
  summarise(prob_4_or_more = sum(probability))


                               


# Finding Probility of a continuous distribution (AREA UNDER GRAPH)
P(wait time <= 7)
punif(7, min = 0, max = 12)
# probability of waiting <= 7 mins = 0.5833
P(wait time >= 7)
punif(7, min = 0, max = 12, lower.tail = FALSE)
# probability of waiting >= 7 mins = 0.41776

P(4 <= wait time <= 7) = P(wait time <= 7) - P(wait time <= 4)
punif(7, min = 0, max = 12) - punif(4, min = 0, max = 12)
                               

#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! punif() and runif() !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#######################
The runif() function
The runif() function generates random numbers from a uniform distribution. A uniform distribution is a distribution in which all values are equally likely. The runif() function takes three arguments:
    n: the number of random numbers to generate
    min: the lower bound of the distribution
    max: the upper bound of the distribution
The default values for min and max are 0 and 1, respectively.

Here is an example of how to use the runif() function to generate 10 random numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1:
set.seed(123)
r <- runif(10)
                               
Output:
print(r)
 [1] 0.2875775 0.7883051 0.4089769 0.8830174 0.9404673 0.0455565 0.5281055
 [8] 0.8924190 0.5514350 0.4566147

The runif() function can also be used to generate random numbers from other distributions, such as the normal distribution, the Poisson distribution, and the binomial distribution.            
The punif() function
The punif() function calculates the cumulative probability density function (CDF) of the uniform distribution. The CDF is the probability that a random variable will be less than or equal to a certain value.
The punif() function takes three arguments:
    x: the value at which to calculate the CDF
    min: the lower bound of the distribution
    max: the upper bound of the distribution

Here is an example of how to use the punif() function to calculate the CDF of a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 at the value 0.5:
set.seed(123)
p <- punif(0.5, min = 0, max = 1)
                               
Output:
print(p)
[1] 0.5
This means that there is a 50% chance that a random variable from this distribution will be less than or equal to 0.5.
